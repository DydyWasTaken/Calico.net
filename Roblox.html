        <h1>Why Roblox ?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Roblox looks like a kid game to many, but it's more rather than just a simple game platform, it helped me to understand alot about programming.</p>
            <p>So i started making many things for Roblox games such as 3D models, game prototypes or exploits because it was fun and very entertaining to me.</p>

            <p>So i focused on one game, Jailbreak which is a cop vs criminals game, Probably one of the most know game on Roblox. It looks like GTA but in a cheap version.</p>
            <p>Despite the game being not as good as GTA, i love the style of the game and the amount of effort and work put into it (it shows that a simplistic game in some aspects can be good as a very complete game), so i really wanted to contribute to it, it could be a way to get popular too since this game has now 6B visits.</p>

            <p>So here's on of my first submissions for the game, it's very simplistic because it needs to be in "low poly style" to match the game environement.</p>
            <p>I posted it for the first time on twitter and then on reddit as a "submission ticket" to get it in game, since the community has to chose if it can be added or not with upvotes.</p>
            <p>This post really started everything, even if it didn't get added, it got me alot of followers (around 60) and a lot of upvotes (around 600 upvotes), this time i knew i could do more for people.</p>

            <p>After a year or two, i finally got my own car in the game, it became for a moment the most upvoted creation with "vehicle" flair on the r/JailbreakCreations subreddit.</p>
            <p>For season 10 of the game it was the final grand prize to unlock, a good overall car with the design of the Bugatti La Voiture Noire, this is the creation that boosted me from 250 followers to 600 in some weeks.</p>
            <p>This car still available in game but can't be purchased, it became a collectible/limited car.</p>

        <h1>Music you said ?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Yes, i really like music, i can listen to any type of music but i really like J-pop such as Yoasobi, im listening to them since 9th grade.</p>
            <p>But theres also Imperial Circus Dead Decadence, a japanese metal group, i really love their songs. Songs i said here are completly opposite genres but i guess like weird things sometimes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <p>I also listen to 2000s songs such as Timbaland old songs or Chris brown ones.</p>

        <h1>Culture maybe ?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I'm caribbean, i was born in martinique in 2004 and im the only among my brother and sister to be from there, i didn't lived in Martinique for very long, around 4 years only but i loved the times when we went to beach every weekends, making big parties and having fun with the whole familly.</p>
            <p>Even if i'm a caribbean enjoyer, since 7th grade i love everything about Japan, from culture, history (for obvious reasons not everything), music, gaming, language and girls obviously.</p>
            <p>Later i'm probably going to move there for a moment, i hope with someone like a friend or something for more fun.</p>

            <p>No. never in my life i got any interactions with one, i'll explain why under this.</p>

        <h1>So what about socials interactions ?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I'm a very calm, and introverted person, i like to stay with the same friends most of the time so getting new ones is hard for me.</p>
            <p>The weird thing is i'm confortable to talk to strangers even if i'm introverted, I like to be nice to everyone even it the person acts like trash so i can take anything, it won't change anything for me except sentimental things i would say.</p>
            <p>About girls it's practically the same thing, i don't talk most of the time with girls, except if she starts talking to me.</p>
            <p>the only moment you will see me talking from myself to a girl is if i really love her, theses types of things really motivates me i guess ?</p>

            <p>There's 2 things, the first one is im start to feel alone very quickly if no ones talks to me.</p>
            <p>And the second thing is because of this i became a master in the art of lying, i could lie for anything that can bring attention.</p>
            <p>What you can do against this is either talking to me regulary or ask for proofs when you think im lying, sometimes i can't proof what im saying so maybe it can work. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

            <p>I started programming with Roblox at first, it uses LUA language, a pretty basic but can be used in crazy projects such as HellRaver, a Roblox game inspired by Doom with probably the best graphics/mechanics ratio you can get.</p>

            <p>So if you're wondering how i managed to get a custom car in an online game like Roblox, i simply used script executor commonly called a hack.</p>
            <p>I wrote a script that replaces existing car models in game and then import cars i made over, it took me around 2 months to get a stable exploit that i can release to the public.</p>
            <P>You want to try it ? Well it still available at my <a href="https://github.com/DydyWasTaken/RJBCI">Github</a> page, the repo is called JBCI (Jailbreak Car Importer)</P>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Yes, during highschool i learned Python for Databases, not a fan of this but it can be usefull later i guess</p>
            <p>I also know the basics of C++, since i want to make my own Raycast rendering engine, it's one of the best languages for graphics rendering.</p>
            <p>Also theres aditional HTML and CSS i learned recently, which explains how i made everything here.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Now im curretly learning C# for unity 3D, since i have a working 3D game to release before June 2023, no one belives it possible for me, but we'll see if they should have trusted me or not.</p>
            <p>Here's my progress at the time im writting this (It's 3:20 A.M, we are the 11/12/2022 and im fucking depressed).</p>

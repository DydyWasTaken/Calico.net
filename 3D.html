        <h1>How it started</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>One day i saw my dad doing 3D modeling, he's pretty skilled and showed me his projects.</p>
            <p>So when i had right to use his pc, i tried modeling but it was very bad since i didn't have any clue how to use it, but it was very satisfying to use still.</p>
            <p>But one day i remember succefully making a tire model, pretty basic one but i was so happy to show this to him, best felling in the world, so i wanted to do this with other people.</p>

                <p>I waited to get my very first pc, it had a nvidia geforce GT260, a intel i7 2700k and 16 GB of ram not even enough to model on blender but i still used it for. As you can see i got insane artifacts on that project, it was a roblox head with realistic hairs, i pushed way too far the values and ended up with this.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Here it's my very first and unfinished car model, it was a crazy achievement for me, not enough yet to finish it but i knew there was progress in my work even if no one saw this at the time. The screenshots are very blurry, i took a photo directly because i was stupid as hell, not as much as now but enough for theses kinds of things.</p>

            <p>Yes, there some cool things i made, my favourites ones are the ortographic scenes, theses are some scene with a view where there's no depth, even if it's a 3D object</p>
